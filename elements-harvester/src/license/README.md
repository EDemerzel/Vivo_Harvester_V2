#THIRD-PARTY.properties file
This file exists to specify the open source licence for any dependencies that do not specify their licences in a way that the dependency licensing plugin can process.

The licensing plugin updates the *dependencies/ListOfDependenciesAndLicences.txt* file whenever the mvn "package" command is invoked.

***Note:** Nothing in this folder relates to the license terms of this project, for that see the LICENSE file in the root folder.*
